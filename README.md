# 🚨 Identifying and Analyzing Network/Host Intrusion Detection System (NIDS/HIDS) Alerts 🚨

## 📝 Description

Welcome to the world of **Intrusion Detection Systems**—where every packet tells a story, and we're here to read between the lines! In this lab, we dove into both **Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)** and **Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS)** to uncover suspicious activities lurking in a virtual environment. Grab your detective hats, because this is where the fun begins! 🕵️‍♂️🔍

### 🔧 Key Tasks:

#### 1. **Network Scanning with Zenmap**
- Launched **Zenmap** (the friendlier face of Nmap) to scan specific IP ranges like a pro. 🌐
- Collected data on open ports and services running on network targets. Nothing gets by us!

#### 2. **Network Security Monitoring with Sguil**
- Fired up **Sguil** on **Security Onion VM** to keep a close eye on network traffic in real time. 🎛️
- Detected and analyzed events triggered by those sneaky network scans, including OS detection alerts. 🔥
- Generated detailed reports and dissected packet data like a cybersecurity Sherlock Holmes. 🧐

#### 3. **Security Monitoring with Squert**
- Jumped into **Squert** to explore security events through an intuitive web interface. 🕸️
- Visualized network alerts, analyzed trends, and detected suspicious patterns like the pros do. 🎨📊

In short, this lab was all about using powerful security tools to monitor, detect, and respond to potential threats. Because when it comes to network defense, we don't leave anything to chance! ⚔️💻

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade:

- **Zenmap**: Nmap's stylish cousin, making network scanning look good. 📡
- **Sguil**: Our command center for live network monitoring and alert analysis. 🛡️
- **Security Onion**: The foundation of our IDS/IPS investigation—because who doesn't love layers? 🧅
- **Squert**: For when you want your security data with a side of visualization. 🎨

---

## 🖥️ Environments Used:

- **Kali Linux**: The hacker's Swiss Army knife, giving us all the tools to get the job done. 🐉💻

---

In conclusion, this lab taught us how to master the fine art of **network forensics**. Armed with the best tools in the biz, we analyzed threats, tracked suspicious activity, and proved that when it comes to network security, nothing gets past us! 🕵️‍♀️🔐
