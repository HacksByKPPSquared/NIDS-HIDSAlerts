<h1>Identifying and Analyzing Network/Host Intrusion Detection System (NIDS/HIDS) Alerts</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This lab focuses on utilizing both network and host intrusion detection systems to identify and analyze suspicious activities in a virtual environment. The following key tasks were performed:

<b>Network Scanning with Zenmap</b>

Used Zenmap, a GUI for Nmap, to scan network targets within specific IP ranges.
Conducted various types of scans to gather data on open ports and services running on systems within the network.
Network Security Monitoring with Sguil

Launched Sguil on a Security Onion VM to monitor network traffic and analyze real-time events.
Identified and reviewed events triggered by network scans, including NMAP OS detection alerts.
Generated detailed reports based on detected events and analyzed packet data.
Security Monitoring using Squert

Explored Squert, a web interface for viewing and analyzing security events.
Accessed detailed visualizations of network security alerts and analyzed trends and patterns in the data.
This lab demonstrates the use of various security tools for intrusion detection, network monitoring, and event analysis, providing a comprehensive look at managing and responding to network threats.
